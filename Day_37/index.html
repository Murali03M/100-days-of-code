    Vector implements List <strong>Interface. Like ArrayList it also maintains</strong>strong> insertion order but it is rarely used in non-thread environment as it is synchronized and due to which it gives poor performance in searching, adding, delete and update of its elements.
    Three ways to create vector class object: Method 1:Vector vec = new Vector();
    It creates an empty Vector with the default initial capacity of 10. It means the Vector will be re-sized when the 11th elements needs to be inserted into the Vector. Note: By default vector doubles its size. i.e. In this case the Vector size would remain 10 till 10 insertions and once we try to insert the 11th element It would become 20 (double of default capacity 10).
